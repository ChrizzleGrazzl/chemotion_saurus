**Charaterization of compounds**

<b>New compounds:</b> New compounds (not literature known compounds) must be provided with analytical data that adequately approve the identity and degree of purity (homogeneity) of the compound. <br />
<b>Known compounds</b> that exist in the Chemotion repository: At least one evidence for the identity and purity of the compound must be provided. A combination of 1H or 13C NMR and mass spec is desired.<br />
<b>Known compounds</b> that do not exist in the Chemotion repository: please provide analytical data that adequately approves the identity and degree of purity (homogeneity) of the compound. <br />
Details describing the required data are given in the section "Analyses"

:::info Hint
Please provide at least all data that is usually given in a Supplemental Information for publications. For compounds that are literature known but not described in the Chemotion repository, please add all data that you have - to provide a complete dataset for the community.   
:::

<b>Missing data</b>
If a required type of data is not obtainable, the reason for the absence of the data should be noted. For example, if the compound is little soluble and recording a 13C NMR spectrum is not possible or if the compound can be hardly ionized and mass spec cannot be gained, please add a note to "Additional information for publication and purification details". For cases where the data was gained but does not meet the requirements, please see the information in the section <i>analyses</i> of this documentation. <br />
