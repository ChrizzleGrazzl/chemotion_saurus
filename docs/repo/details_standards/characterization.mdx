:::caution Important information for this page
This page contains a collection of ideas to give inline notations for analytical data in the future. We provide this page to discuss options for a clear formatting of descriptions - but there is no need to adapt to the given rules at the moment. This is a test area. Nevertheless: if you have suggestitons and comments: please let us know or provide your ideas via the issue tracking option.

➤ New compounds: Evidence adequate to establish both identity and degree of purity (homogeneity) should be provided (see below).  [5]
➤ Known compounds: Purity documentation must be provided for known compounds whose preparation by a new or improved method is reported (see below). Listings of IR absorptions and NMR resonances for known compounds should be presented only if they do not duplicate previously published data. [5]
➤ In addition, for noncommercial, known compounds used as starting materials, the method of preparation and the literature data used to confirm the materials’ identity must be cited. [5]
➤ For all new compounds, a listing of 1H and 13C resonances, either HRMS or elemental analysis data and important IR absorptions should be included in the experimental details section. Hydrogen multiplicity (C, CH, CH2, CH3) information obtained from routine DEPT spectra should be included. If detailed peak assignments are made, the type of NOESY or COSY methods used to establish atom connectivities and spatial relationships should be identified in the Supporting Information. [5]
➤ If a required type of data is not obtainable, the reason for the absence of the data should be noted in the experimental section of the Supporting Information. For example, if the compound is too insoluble to record a 13C NMR spectrum or the compound is too unstable to obtain a good elemental analysis [5]
➤ A melting point range should be reported for all crystalline compounds. Melting points of noncrystalline amorphous compounds should not be reported.  [5]
➤ Chemical shift values should be included for all peaks arising from the compound in the 1H and 13C spectra [5]
➤ Display the NMR baseline and include the minimum chemical shift range: [5]
-1-9 ppm for 1H spectra
-10-190 ppm for 13C spectra
Extended range for functional groups that resonate from 9-14 ppm


 ➤ All new organic, organometallic, and inorganic compounds, and materials must be fully characterized by appropriate analytical methods with sufficient evidence for composition, structure, and purity (e.g., elemental analysis, 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies, high-resolution mass spectrometry, mass spectrometry, IR spectroscopy, specific rotation, physical state and melting point, X-ray crystallography, electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction, etc.). The identity and bulk purity of compounds and materials should be verified with elemental analysis or, in exceptional circumstances, by another appropriate method. For instance, when the compound is unstable or not available in sufficient quantities for complete analysis, the exact relative molecular mass obtained by high-resolution mass spectrometry and clean 1H and 13C NMR spectra (appended to the Supporting Information for inspection by the referees) should be supplied. Reasons should be provided if a type of data could not be obtained for a compound or compound class.[3]
➤ In any cases where elemental analysis cannot be carried out (e.g., for air-sensitive compounds) an explanation for the omission or inaccuracy of this data should be given, alongside additional evidence for purity. HPLC or GC chromatograms are suitable, but other techniques (e.g., NMR spectroscopy or powder X-ray diffraction) will be considered.[3]
➤ For known organic, organometallic, and inorganic compounds, characterization by 1H and 13C NMR spectroscopies and mass spectrometry is sufficient and purity should be verified. A reference to the fully characterized compound should be provided. Any soluble organometallic or inorganic diamagnetic compound with an organic fragment should be characterized using NMR spectroscopy (1H, 13C, and any other appropriate nucleus) in the same manner as organic compounds. For soluble paramagnetic compounds (e.g., CuII complexes), paramagnetic NMR techniques are encouraged but not essential.[3]
➤ Isomeric mixtures: Where isomeric mixtures are reported, such as diastereomeric or enantioenriched mixtures, please provide percentage compositions and information about how these values were obtained (e.g., NMR spectroscopy, HPLC, etc.). If certain spectroscopic signals (e.g., NMR signals) can be attributed to either of the isomers, these data should be reported in separate lists and not in combined lists.[3]
➤ Microscopy images should be captured at an appropriate magnification to show a representative sample. When high-magnification images of selected particles are used they must be supplemented by low-magnification images of the broader sample, and the use of histograms and statistics to describe size and shape distributions is encouraged.[3]
