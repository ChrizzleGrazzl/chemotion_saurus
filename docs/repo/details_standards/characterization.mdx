:::caution Important information for this page
This page contains a collection of ideas to give inline notations for analytical data in the future. We provide this page to discuss options for a clear formatting of descriptions - but there is no need to adapt to the given rules at the moment. This is a test area. Nevertheless: if you have suggestitons and comments: please let us know or provide your ideas via the issue tracking option.

➤ New compounds: Evidence adequate to establish both identity and degree of purity (homogeneity) should be provided (see below).  [5]
➤ Known compounds: Purity documentation must be provided for known compounds whose preparation by a new or improved method is reported (see below). Listings of IR absorptions and NMR resonances for known compounds should be presented only if they do not duplicate previously published data. [5]
➤ In addition, for noncommercial, known compounds used as starting materials, the method of preparation and the literature data used to confirm the materials’ identity must be cited. [5]
➤ For all new compounds, a listing of 1H and 13C resonances, either HRMS or elemental analysis data and important IR absorptions should be included in the experimental details section. Hydrogen multiplicity (C, CH, CH2, CH3) information obtained from routine DEPT spectra should be included. If detailed peak assignments are made, the type of NOESY or COSY methods used to establish atom connectivities and spatial relationships should be identified in the Supporting Information. [5]
➤ If a required type of data is not obtainable, the reason for the absence of the data should be noted in the experimental section of the Supporting Information. For example, if the compound is too insoluble to record a 13C NMR spectrum or the compound is too unstable to obtain a good elemental analysis [5]
➤ A melting point range should be reported for all crystalline compounds. Melting points of noncrystalline amorphous compounds should not be reported.  [5]
➤ Chemical shift values should be included for all peaks arising from the compound in the 1H and 13C spectra [5]
➤ Display the NMR baseline and include the minimum chemical shift range: [5]
-1-9 ppm for 1H spectra
-10-190 ppm for 13C spectra
Extended range for functional groups that resonate from 9-14 ppm
