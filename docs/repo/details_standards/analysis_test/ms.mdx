## Mass spectrometry data **extension**

1. Please give mass spectra in the form of the following examples. Important conventions are the listing of signals with their intensity (in round brackets) and the assignment of fragments to the corresponding sum formula [in squared brackets].
   The preferred option is (standard according to KIT):

- EI (m/z (%), 70 eV, 70 °C): 278 (72) [M]<sup>+</sup>, 221 (100), 147 (31), 115 (15), 103 (23); HRMS–EI (m/z): [M]<sup>+</sup> calcd for C15H18OS2, 278.0794; found, 278.0795.

another option is (standard according to RWTH Aachen):

- HRMS (ESI+, MeCN) (%): m/z, found = 663.24608 (100), 664.24910 (37), 665.24508 (48), 666.24762 (17), 667.25040 (3); m/z, calc. = 663.24630 [12C321H4063Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (100), 664.24966 [12C3113C1H4063Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (35), 665.24449 [12C321H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (45), 666.24785 [12C3113C1H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (15), 667.25120 [12C3013C21H4065Cu14N816O4<sup>+</sup>] (3).

2. Please ensure that the peak with the highest detected molecular mass belongs to your molecule (either as fragment if the molecule peak is not found, or as part of a formed complex/dimer or similar). If there are signals with a higher mass than your product, please explain these masses and give this explanation in brackets after the signal in the signal list.
3. Please start with the highest detected mass and finish with the lowest.
4. Please give isotope patterns for Cl- and Br-containing compounds

- EI (m/z, 70 eV, 70 °C): 278/280 (72/72) [M]<sup>+</sup>, 221/223 (100/100), 103 (23).
