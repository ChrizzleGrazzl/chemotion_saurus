:::caution Important information for this page
This page contains a collection of ideas to give inline notations for analytical data in the future. We provide this page to discuss options for a clear formatting of descriptions - but there is no need to adapt to the given rules at the moment. This is a test area. Nevertheless: if you have suggestions and comments: please let us know or provide your ideas via the issue tracking option.

## Completeness

**New compounds:** New compounds (not literature known compounds) must be provided with analytical data that adequately approve the identity and degree of purity (homogeneity) of the compound. <br />
Typically, the following data needs to be provided: 
**NMR data:** 1H NMR, 13C NMR data, methods to gain information on Hydrogen multiplicity (C, CH, CH2, CH3) such as DEPT, HSQC, HMBC or NOESY NMR data for approving the assignment of signals to atoms. For details, please see [NMR](analysis_test/nmr) <br />
**Mass spectrometry data** including HRMS: <br />
**IR or Raman** spectra <br />
**melting point (range)**: should be reported for all crystalline compounds. Melting points of noncrystalline amorphous compounds should not be reported. <br />
**Elemental analysis**:.<br />


## Order of analyses

Please order the analysis part of your molecules/samples according to:

1. <sup>1</sup>H NMR,
2. <sup>13</sup>C NMR,
3. Other [NMR](analysis_test/nmr) data,
4. [Mass Spectroscopy](analysis_test/ms) data,
5. IR data, and
6. Others (EA, crystal structures)
   For collecting data in the ELN/repository, please use the "order mode" button in the analysis tab. For inline notation, please add one technique after the other, separated by ".".

If detailed peak assignments are made, the type of NOESY or COSY methods used to establish atom connectivities and spatial <br />relationships should be identified in the Supporting Information.
