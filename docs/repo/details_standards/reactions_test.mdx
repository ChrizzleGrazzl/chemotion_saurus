## General aspects

Please ensure that the description of the reaction is as comprehensive as possible. The description of the reaction needs to be understandable and reproducible including all details of a reaction. Common practices - as accepted by some journals - such as giving only one general description used for different reactions are not matching the needs of the repository. Please give a distinct description including the name and amount of the reagents that were used.

- Please ensure that no abbreviations are used that need further explanations. If you need to add abbreviations, please define them in "additional information for publication and purification". For common abbreviations, please see section ["Abbreviations and names"](#abbreviations-and-names)
- Please use the exact name such as the systematic name (IUPAC or Chemical Abstracts) for each title compound of the given reagents instead of general terms such as "the amine", "the aldehyde", the "starting material". 
- Chemical names are not capitalized unless they are the first word of a sentence or are part of a title or heading. Then, the first letter of the syllabic portion is capitalized, not the locant, stereoisomer descriptor, or positional prefix.
- Please add the distinct temperature instead of RT/rt/room temperature, if not otherwise possible, please add the temperature as a range such as "21-25 °C"
- Please add the duration of a reaction as precisely as possible and avoid "overnight"
- Please ensure that no labels from a journals publication are included (e.g. information such as compound No **233c** should be removed)
- Please describe the product obtained with color and physical state, please take care: solids or liquids are usually not white -> they are colorless
- The description of the reaction should end with a sentence that includes the name of the isolated/gained compound and its amount in mg/g, mmol/mol and %. E.g. "After purification, 1-naphthyl-{1-[4-(trifluoromethyl)benzyl]indol-3-yl}methanone (62.3 mg, 145 μmol) was obtained in 27% yield as a colorless solid". The name can be omitted and replaced by "the target compound" or "the product" if the name can only be hardly accessed or is very long.
- Avoid using trademarks and brand names of equipment and reagents. Use generic names; include the trademark in parentheses after the generic name only if the material or product used is somehow different from others. Remember that trademarks often are recognized and available as such only in the country of origin.

## Molecules and their details

Please give all necessary details of the molecules/samples used in the reaction, this includes with respect to the sample (please change in the sample):
- information on the stereochemistry of chiral molecules. If the compound is racemic, please add this information in the field for abs stereoinformation
- information on the melting point for products that are obtained as solid material

#### Chemicals used with less than 100% purity or added as mixture, solution or others

Usually, reactions in Chemotion repository are generated in the reaction mode and chemicals are used as they were defined in the sample. For adaptations which might be required due to a lower purity of the sample or the use of a solution that contains the sample, please open the sample and change the value in the sample edit mode. Typical examples are: <br/>
Use of Pd/C (10%) -> please change the purity of the sample Pd from 1.0 to 0.1.<br/>
Use of an impure reagent (90% purity) -> please change the purity of the reagent from 1.0 to 0.9.<br/>
Use of 1 M reagent -> please set the molarity of the reagent in the sample to 1 M. <br/>
The reaction table in the repository changes the values according to the added purities, molarities. 

#### Giving the amount of solvents/chemicals 
Valid options are:  
(a) 100 mL of ethyl acetate, 
(b) ethyl acetate (100 mL) was added

#### Giving the amount of chemicals used as reagent or reactant 
Valid options are:  
(a) quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (20.0 g, 115 mmol, 1.00 equiv), 
(b) …20.0 g of quinoline-4-carboxylic acid (115 mmol, 1.00 equiv)

#### Giving the amount of chemicals as a product of a reaction 
The yield of a product of a reaction is given for pure products. If the product is gained as crude compound (due to whatever reason) this has to be clearly given in the form: "crude product was gained". The yield of a reaction should be given in weight, mmol/mol and percentage in parentheses after the compound name (or its equivalent). The informqtion in parentheses is separated by a comma. 
Valid options are: 
(a) Methyl quinoline-4-carboxylate (16.4 g, 87.5 mmol, 76% yield) was isolated as a colorless solid.
(b) Methyl quinoline-4-carboxylate (16.4 g, 87.5 mmol) was isolated as a colorless solid in 76% yield.
(c) Methyl quinoline-4-carboxylate was isolated as a colorless solid in 76% yield (16.4 g, 87.5 mmol).

## Numbers and units
Please adjust the space between numbers and units according to common standards:  
All combinations of number and unit should be given with space, only the combination number+% (e.g. yield or concentration) are given without.
- 12 h (wrong: 12h), 12 min (wrong: 12min), 12 °C (not 12°C), 12 mM (wrong: 12mM)
- But: the product was obtained in 12% yield or 5% methanol in water
➤ data should be quoted with decimal points and negative exponents (e.g., 25.8 J K−1 mol−1). Use the period as the decimal point, never a comma.
➤ Use numerals before and after a decimal point. 0.25 (not .25) 78.0 or 78 (not 78.)
➤ For ranges in scientific notation, retain all parts of all numbers or avoid ambiguity by use of parentheses or other enclosing marks. 9.2 × 10–3 to 12.6 × 10–3 or (9.2–12.6) × 10–3 (not 9.2 to 12.6 × 10–3)
➤ Leave a space before and after mathematical operators that function as verbs or conjunctions; that is, they have numbers on both sides or a symbol for a variable on one side and a number on the other. 20 ± 2% 3.24 ± 0.01 4 × 5 cm 8 × 10–4 k ≥ 420 s–1 p < 0.01 Tg = 176 °C. 
Exception 1 Leave no space around mathematical operators in subscripts and superscripts. ∆Hn–1 Eλ>353 M(x+y)+ 
Exception 2 Leave no space around a slash (a/b), a ratio colon (1:10), or a centered dot (PM·V).
➤ Use an en dash to mean “to” or “through” with a span of three or more numerals or other types of ranges. 12–20 months, Figures 1–4, 5–50 kg, sections 1b–1f, parts C–E, compounds A–I. 
Exception 1: When either one or both numbers are negative or include a symbol that modifies the number, use the word “to” or “through”, not the en dash. –20 to +120 K, –145 to –30 °C, ≈50 to 60, 10 to >600 mL, <5 to 15 mg. 
Exception 2: Do not use an en dash when the word “from” or “between” is used. from 500 to 600 mL (not from 500–600 mL), between 7 and 10 days (not between 7–10 days).
➤ Use numerals with units of time or measure, and use a space between the numeral and the unit, except %, $, ° (angular degrees), ′ (angular minutes), and ″ (angular seconds). 
6 min; 25 mL; 125 V/s; 0.30 g; 50%; $250; 273 K; 47°8′23″; 180° (but 180 °C); 90 °F; 50 µg of compound/dL of water
For very large numbers with units of measure, use scientific notation or choose an appropriate multiplying prefix for the unit to avoid numbers of more than four digits. 1.2 × 106 s; 3.0 × 104 kg; 5.8 × 10–5 M; or 58 µM; 42.3 L (not 42,300 mL or 42 300 mL)
exception 1 In tables, use the same unit and multiplying prefix for all entries in a column, even if some entries therefore require four or more digits. 
exception 2 Use the preferred unit of a discipline, even when the numbers require four or more digits: g/L for mass density of fluids kg/m3 for mass density of solids GPa for modulus of elasticity kPa for fluid pressure MPa for stress
➤ In four-digit numbers, use no commas or spaces.
➤ Use a decimal and a zero following a numeral only when such usage truly represents the precision of the measurement: 27.0 °C and 27 °C are not interchangeable.
➤ Use decimals rather than fractions with units of time or measure, except when doing so would imply an unwarranted accuracy. 3.5 h (not 3½ h) 5.25 g (not 5¼ g)
➤ Use an en dash in ranges or series of three or more numbered items, whether on the line or in a superscript. 43–49 325–372 2005–2008 Tables 1–4[4]

Chemistry-specific general formating 
➤ Use italic type for chemical element symbols that denote attachment to an atom or a site of ligation. B,B′-di-3-pinanyldiborane bis[(ethylthio)acetato-O,S]platinum glycinato-N N-acetyl group N-ethylaniline[4]
➤ When element symbols are used with a type of reaction as a noun or adjective, use roman type for the symbol and hyphenate it to the word that follows it. N-acetylated N-acetylation N-oxidation N-oxidized O-substituted O-substitution
➤ Use italic type for the capital H that denotes indicated or added hydrogen. 1H-1,3-diazepine 3H-fluorene 2H-indene[4]
➤ Use Greek letters, not the spelled-out forms, in chemical names to denote position or stereochemistry. Use a hyphen to separate them from the chemical name. α-amino acid (not alpha amino acid) β-naphthol (not beta naphthol)
➤ Use italic type for positional, stereochemical, configurational, and descriptive structural prefixes when they appear with the chemical name or formula. Use a hyphen to separate them from the chemical name. Accepted prefixes include the following: abeo ac altro amphi anti antiprismo ar arachno as asym c catena cis cisoid closo cyclo d dodecahedro E endo erythro exo facgem hexahedro hexaprismo hypho icosahedro klado l m M mer meso n nido o octahedro p P pentaprismo quadro r R R∗ rel retro ribo s S S∗ sec sn sym syn t tert tetrahedro threo trans transoid triangulo triprismo uns vic xylo Z[4]
➤ Do not capitalize prefixes that are shown here as lowercase, even at the beginning of a sentence or in a title and never use lower case for those that are written in capital letters. Enclose the prefixes E, R, R∗, S, S∗, and Z in parentheses. anti-bicyclo[3.2.1]octan-8-amine; ar-chlorotoluene; cis-diamminedichloroplatinum; cyclo-hexasulfur, c-S6; (E,E)-2,4-hexadienoic acid; m-ethylpropylbenzene; o-dibromobenzene, p-aminoacetanilide; (S)-2,3-dihydroxypropanoic acid; 5-sec-butylnonane.[4]
Multiplying affixes are integral parts of the chemical name; they are set in roman type and are always closed up to the rest of the name (without hyphens). Use hyphens only to set off intervening locants or descriptors. Use enclosing marks (parentheses, brackets, or braces) to ensure clarity or to observe other recommended nomenclature conventions. Multiplying prefixes include the following: • hemi, mono, di, tri, tetra, penta, hexa, hepta, octa, ennea, nona, deca, deka, undeca, dodeca, etc. • semi, uni, sesqui, bi, ter, quadri, quater, quinque, sexi, septi, octi, novi, deci, etc. • bis, tris, tetrakis, pentakis, hexakis, heptakis, octakis, nonakis, decakis, etc. 3,4′-bi-2-naphthol; 2,2′-bipyridine; bis(benzene)chromium(0); 1,4-bis(3-bromo-1- oxopropyl)piperazine; 1,3-bis(diethylamino)propane; di-tert-butyl malonate dichloride.[4]

3.10.3 Completeness
➤ You should provide descriptions of the experiments in enough detail so that a skilled researcher is able to repeat them. Standard techniques and methods used throughout the work should just be stated at the beginning of the experimental section; descriptions of these are not needed. Any unusual hazards about the chemicals, procedures or equipment should be clearly identified. [5]
➤ Only non-standard apparatus should be described; commercially available instruments are referred to by their stock numbers (for example, Perkin-Elmer 457 or Varian HA-100 spectrometers). The accuracy of primary measurements should be stated. Figures should include error bars where appropriate, and results should be accompanied by analysis of experimental uncertainty. [5]
➤ Identify the materials used and give information on the degree of and criteria for purity, but do not reference standard laboratory reagents. Give the chemical names of all compounds and the chemical formulas of compounds that are new or uncommon. Use meaningful nomenclature; that is, use standard systematic nomenclature where specificity and complexity require, or use trivial nomenclature where it will adequately and unambiguously define a well-established compound. [4]
➤ Describe apparatus only if it is not standard or not commercially available. Giving a company name and model number in parentheses is nondistracting and adequate to identify standard equipment. [4]
➤ when measurement conditions remain unchanged, they need only be mentioned once, for instance in column headings[2]
➤ New synthetic procedures should contain reactant quantities in weight or volume and molar units. Equipment details, such as reaction vessel, type of heating (conventional, microwave, or photoirradiation), irradiation wavelength, optical irradiance, cut-off filters, and details of purification techniques and solvents, among others, should be included. [3]
➤ Describe the procedures used, unless they are established and standard. 
➤ Note and emphasize any hazards, such as explosive or pyrophoric tendencies and toxicity, in a separate paragraph introduced by the heading “Caution:”. Include precautionary handling procedures, special waste disposal procedures, and any other safety considerations in adequate detail so that workers repeating the experiments can take appropriate safety measures. Some ACS journals also indicate hazards as footnotes on their content´s pages.[4]
➤ New procedures should be fully described in detail to ensure reproducibility. [5]
➤ Reactant quantities and product yields should be reported in weight and molar units; percentage yields should only be reported for materials of demonstrated purity   [5]
➤ The Editors encourage authors to emphasize any unexpected, new, and/or significant hazards or risks associated with the reported work, including the use of toxic and/or environmentally persistent reagents and solvents, and provide a rationale on choice of these reagents and solvents. Organic Letters further encourages authors to consider the Principles of Green Chemistry in carrying out their research and consider reporting metrics such as atom economy, mass efficiency, E-factor, or others. For more information, please consult Research Tools provided by the ACS Green Chemistry Institute. [5]
➤ For synthetic procedures, include: reactant quantities, detailed purification techniques, product quantities, isolated yields, physical state/description of the compounds (i.e., color, solid, etc.) and characterization data [5]
